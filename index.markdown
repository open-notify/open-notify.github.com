# Open APIs From Space

**Open Notify** is an open source project to provide a simple programming
interface for some of NASA's awesome data. I do some of the work to take raw
data and turn them into [APIs](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/api-good-technology-explained/)
related to space and spacecraft.


## Projects

### APIs:

 - [Current Location of the International Space Station](/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now)

    - Example: {% include issnow.html %}

 - [Overhead Pass Predictions for the International Space Station](/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Pass-Times)
 - [Number of People in Space](/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space)

    - Example: {% include astros.html %}
