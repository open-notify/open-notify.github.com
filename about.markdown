# About Open Notify

Open Notify started as a
[thrown together project at Science Hack Day SF in 2010](http://mechanicalintegrator.com/2010/near-earth-asteroid-lamp-at-science-hack-day-sf/).
From there I built a 
[lamp that lights up when the International Space Station flies over](http://mechanicalintegrator.com/2011/iss-notify/).
I needed data to run the lamp so I made a simple service that calculated the upcoming
pass times for a given location.

Eventually I added other services like the current location of the ISS and the number of
people in space.
